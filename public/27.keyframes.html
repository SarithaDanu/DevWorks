            Overview
            Udemy is a platform that allows instructors to build online courses on their preferred topics. Using Udemy's course development tools, instructors can upload videos, source code for developers, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, audio, ZIP files and any other content that learners might find helpful. Instructors can also engage and interact with users via online discussion boards.[25]
            
            Courses are offered across a wide breadth of categories, including business and entrepreneurship, academics, the arts, health and fitness, language, music, and technology.[26] Most classes are in practical subjects such as AWS and Azure training, Excel software or using an iPhone camera.[27] Udemy also offers Udemy Business (formerly Udemy for Business), enabling businesses access to a targeted suite of over 7,000 training courses[3] on topics from digital marketing tactics to office productivity, design, management, programming, and more. With Udemy Business, organizations can also create custom learning portals for corporate training.[28] For smaller companies, Udemy offers a Udemy Team Plan that is a limited seat license but identical content to that of Udemy Business.
